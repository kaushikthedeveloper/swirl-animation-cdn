Inspired by [Swirl Animation](https://github.com/crnacura/AmbientCanvasBackgrounds).

Expands upon the animation by :
- Optimising on the rendering process
- Rendering the animation only when elements with class name `play-background-animation` are visible (pause the animation rendering when its not visible)
